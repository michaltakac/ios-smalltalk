# iospharo

A Pharo Smalltalk VM for iOS and macOS, written as a clean C++ interpreter.

## Overview

iospharo runs standard Pharo 13 and Pharo 14 images on iOS devices and Mac
(via Catalyst). It is a from-scratch interpreter implementation — not a port
of the Cog JIT VM — with full support for the Sista V1 bytecode set, FFI with
callbacks, and the standard Pharo test suite.

**Note:** Pharo 12 and earlier use a different class table layout that the VM
does not yet handle.

## Status

**VM core (solid):**
- **99.90% test pass rate** on Mac Catalyst (13,040 / 13,053)
- **99.55% test pass rate** on iOS Simulator
- FFI with callbacks (sigsetjmp/siglongjmp)
- All standard VM plugins built-in (B2D, JPEG, DSA, SSL, etc.)
- Third-party libraries: cairo, freetype, harfbuzz, pixman, libpng, OpenSSL, libssh2, libgit2

**GUI (working):**
- Metal rendering pipeline — Pharo desktop renders correctly
- Menu bar, world menu, and context menus all functional
- Touch-to-mouse event translation (tap, long-press, two-finger, pinch, drag)
- Hardware keyboard support with modifier keys
- Image library with download, import, and catalog management

## Install from the App Store

Available for iPad, iPhone, and Mac:

[Download on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pharosmalltalk/id6759073615)

**Requirements:**
- iPad (5th gen / 2017 or newer) or iPhone (6s / 2015 or newer) or Mac (Apple Silicon or Intel)
- iOS / iPadOS 15.0 or later, macOS 14.0 or later

Pharo images are downloaded in-app (no separate download needed).

## Beta Testing (TestFlight)

There may be a newer pre-release version available via TestFlight:

1. Install **TestFlight** from the App Store (free, ~30 MB)
2. Open this invite link on your iPad or iPhone: [Join the Beta](https://testflight.apple.com/join/kGmPQFr9)
3. Tap "Accept" then "Install" — the app appears on your home screen

TestFlight builds expire after 90 days but auto-update when new builds
are published.

## Prerequisites

Install these before building:

```bash
# Xcode command-line tools (includes clang, make, etc.)
xcode-select --install

# CMake (build system)
brew install cmake

# For third-party library builds (cairo, freetype, etc.)
brew install meson ninja pkg-config autoconf automake libtool
```

You also need:
- **Xcode 15+** (for the iOS/Mac Catalyst app)
- **A Pharo 13 or 14 image** — download from https://pharo.org/download

## Building

### Step 1: Build libffi and SDL2 xcframeworks

```bash
scripts/build-libffi.sh
scripts/build-sdl2.sh
```

This downloads, cross-compiles, and packages libffi (FFI/callbacks) and SDL2
(display driver) as xcframeworks for iOS device, simulator, Mac Catalyst, and
macOS. Takes about 10 minutes. The xcframeworks are gitignored due to size.

### Step 2: Build third-party libraries

Cairo, freetype, harfbuzz, pixman, libpng, OpenSSL, libssh2, and libgit2
are cross-compiled as static xcframeworks:

```bash
scripts/build-third-party.sh
```

This downloads source tarballs and builds for iOS device, Simulator, and Mac Catalyst.
Takes about 15 minutes on first run. Use `--no-crypto` to skip OpenSSL and libssh2
(libgit2 is always built for local repository support).

### Step 3: Build the app

```bash
open iospharo.xcodeproj
```

Select your target (iOS device, Simulator, or My Mac - Catalyst) and build.

Xcode has a "Check XCFramework Freshness" build phase that automatically runs
`scripts/build-xcframework.sh` whenever VM source files (`src/vm/`, `src/platform/`)
are newer than the xcframework. The first Xcode build will take several minutes
while it compiles the VM; subsequent builds are fast unless you change VM sources.

To manually rebuild the VM xcframework (e.g. after a git pull):

```bash
scripts/build-xcframework.sh
```

This produces `Frameworks/PharoVMCore.xcframework` with slices for iOS device
(arm64), iOS Simulator (arm64 + x86_64), and Mac Catalyst (arm64 + x86_64).

**Code signing (optional):** To deploy to a physical device or the App Store,
copy `Local.xcconfig.example` to `Local.xcconfig` and fill in your Apple
Developer Team ID. `Local.xcconfig` is gitignored.

### Quick development build (Mac only)

For faster iteration on VM internals. This builds a headless command-line binary
(not the iOS/Catalyst app). Requires Steps 1 and 2 above — the cmake build
links against the xcframeworks in `Frameworks/`.

```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build

# Run headless with a Pharo image
./build/test_load_image /path/to/Pharo.image
```

## Architecture

┌─────────────────────────────┐
│   SwiftUI App               │
│   (ContentView, Settings)   │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│   PharoBridge.swift         │  VM lifecycle, event bridge

├─────────────────────────────┤
│   C++ Interpreter           │  Sista V1 bytecodes, GC,
│   (libPharoVMCore.a)        │  FFI, primitives, plugins
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

The image's OSSDL2Driver calls SDL2 functions via FFI. Our SDL2 stubs bridge
these to the Metal rendering pipeline. Touch gestures are mapped to Pharo
mouse events (tap=left-click, long-press=right-click, two-finger tap=right-click).

### Startup patches

The app applies Smalltalk patches on every launch to fix image bugs and adapt
to VM differences (stubbed SDL2, missing font glyphs, etc.). Patches are
version-specific — the app detects the Pharo version and loads `startup-13.st`
or `startup-14.st` accordingly. Users can add custom patches by creating
`startup-user.st` next to the image file (it is never overwritten).
See [docs/startup-system.md](docs/startup-system.md) for the full details.

## Configuration

VM parameters are set in `PharoBridge.swift` when calling `vm_init()`:

  maxOldSpaceSize   2 GB    Max heap (virtual, lazy commit)
  edenSize          10 MB   Young generation size
  maxCodeSize       0       JIT code space (unused)

## Benchmarking

### Quick benchmark (built-in)

The simplest performance check — already in every Pharo image:

```bash
# On the reference Cog VM:
pharo /tmp/Pharo.image eval "1 tinyBenchmarks"
# => "2718114840 bytecodes/sec; 247952910 sends/sec"

# On our VM (results written to Transcript):
./build/test_load_image /tmp/Pharo.image
```

### Benchmark suite

A self-contained benchmark runner that measures 10 workloads and writes
results to `/tmp/pharo_benchmarks.txt`:

```bash
# Inject benchmarks into a fresh image, run on both VMs, compare:
scripts/run_benchmarks.sh

# Or run on just our VM:
scripts/run_benchmarks.sh --ours-only
```

Benchmarks included:

    Benchmark       What it measures
    tinyBenchmarks  Built-in sieve + fibonacci (bytecodes/sec, sends/sec)
    fibonacci(34)   Recursive fib — pure message send overhead
    sieve(100)      Sieve of Eratosthenes — array access + loop cost
    sort(100K)      Sort shuffled array — comparison + collection ops
    dict(100K)      Dictionary put + get — hashing + lookup
    sum(1M)         Sum integers via do: — block/closure + arithmetic
    factorial(10K)  10000! — large integer arithmetic
    block(1M)       1M block evaluations — closure overhead
    instVar(1M)     1M getter/setter — accessor cost
    create(100K)    100K object allocations — GC pressure

Results go to `/tmp/pharo_benchmarks.txt` (one file per VM). The shell
script prints a side-by-side comparison table when run on both VMs.

### External benchmark suites

For more rigorous benchmarking, these community suites work with any
Pharo VM:

- **[Are We Fast Yet](https://github.com/smarr/are-we-fast-yet)** —
  14 cross-language benchmarks (Richards, DeltaBlue, Mandelbrot, NBody,
  etc.) with Pharo implementations. The standard for cross-VM comparison.
  See Marr, Daloze, and Mossenboeck, "Cross-Language Compiler
  Benchmarking — Are We Fast Yet?", DLS 2016.
- **[SMark](https://github.com/smarr/SMark)** (MIT, Stefan Marr) —
  test-like framework for repeatable benchmarks with warmup, iteration
  control, and statistical reporting.
- **[Computer Language Benchmarks Game](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/measurements/pharo.html)** —
  Pharo entries for binary-trees, mandelbrot, n-body, spectral-norm, etc.

## Experiments

The `experiments/` directory contains self-contained demos that showcase what
you can build on top of the Pharo VM with native Metal acceleration and
live Smalltalk coding.

- **[PharoWaveSim](experiments/PharoWaveSim/)** — Interactive 2D wave
  propagation simulation.  Metal GPU compute drives the physics while
  Smalltalk handles the UI.  Tap the screen to create waves that propagate,
  reflect, and interfere in real time.

Each experiment adds its own Smalltalk file (loaded at startup), a Metal
shader (compiled into the app), and C++/ObjC++ glue registered in the VM's
FFI cache.  See `experiments/PharoWaveSim/README.md` for the full breakdown.

  Run the full Pharo SUnit test suite headless with a fake GUI (click menus,
  press buttons, take screenshots — no display needed). Extracted from this
  project but works with any Spur VM. Included here as a submodule at
  `scripts/pharo-headless-test/`.
